# Session 1 — 2026-01-19

Issues worked
- #1 Repository bootstrap and operating rules

Work summary
- Created GitHub repo `dave0875/HealthDelta`.
- Created and corrected Issue #1 body to match the required story template.
- Bootstrapped initial repo skeleton: guardrails (`AGENTS.md`), docs stubs, `.codex/` audit structure, templates, and `TIME.csv` header.
- Generated a structured self-review using local Ollama (`llama3.1:8b`) and recorded it in `docs/reviews/2026-01-19_1.md`.
- Appended a `TIME.csv` row for this session referencing Issue #1.

Decisions
- Interpreted “Issue accepted” as “issue created and meeting quality bar” for bootstrapping, since a repository is required to host issues.

Follow-ups
- Create the remaining “Required Initial Issues” as small, testable vertical slices when ready.
- Commit and push changes referencing Issue #1.
