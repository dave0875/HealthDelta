# ISSUE-0058: Governance: TIME.csv + session evidence for Issues #54 and #56

GitHub: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/58

## Objective
Record required TIME.csv entries and evidence links for recently completed CD work.

## Context / Why
TIME.csv and evidence links in session logs are mandatory. Issues #54 and #56 were completed and validated (including a successful tag-based Release run). This issue records the required governance artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `TIME.csv` includes new rows referencing Issues #54 and #56.
- `.codex/sessions/2026-01-22/session_49.md` includes PR + CI evidence links and the successful tag Release run link for backend image publish/verification.
- `.codex/sessions/2026-01-22/session_50.md` includes PR + CI evidence links and the successful tag Release run link proving the tag version fix.
- CI remains green.

## Test Plan
- N/A (governance-only change).
