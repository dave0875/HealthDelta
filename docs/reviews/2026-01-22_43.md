# Review — Issue 43 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/43

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Added `Release` workflow to build/share CLI distribution artifacts on `main` and publish GitHub Releases on `v*` tags.
- Added ADR + runbook defining “production targets” and what constitutes deployment proof for CLI vs iOS at this stage.
- Updated governance docs and issue template to require explicit deployment-proof naming when issues affect deployable artifacts.

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Met (ADR/runbook/workflow/governance updates present; tag-based release publishing supported).
- Security: Uses standard `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions for release publishing; no health data is involved and runbook reiterates that exports must never be uploaded.
- Determinism/auditability: Artifact name `cli-dist` is stable; release assets are derived from `dist/*` and recorded via workflow evidence.

Risks / edge cases
- Reproducible Python wheels are not guaranteed by default; this issue establishes publication and proof paths, not byte-for-byte reproducible builds.
- iOS “production deployment” remains deferred until signing/TestFlight credentials are explicitly handled in a dedicated issue.
