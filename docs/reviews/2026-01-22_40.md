# Review — Issue 40 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/40

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Added `docs/runbook_ios_export.md` describing iOS incremental export artifacts and how to ingest them into the Python toolchain.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reference the runbook.

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Met (runbook added; referenced from `AGENTS.md`; CI required before closure).
- Privacy: Runbook emphasizes iOS exports are sensitive and should not be committed or uploaded; recommends share-safe workflows for collaboration.
- Determinism: Runbook documents deterministic on-device layout and deterministic staging/analysis commands.

Risks / edge cases
- Transfer mechanics vary by operator environment; runbook intentionally describes an abstract “copy run directory” workflow rather than prescribing a single tool.
