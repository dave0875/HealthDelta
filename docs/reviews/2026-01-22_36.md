# Review — Issue 36 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/36

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Added deterministic iOS `manifest.json` generation via `IOSExportManifestWriter` (run_id, file list with sha256/size_bytes, row_counts).
- Implemented streaming-safe hashing and row counting (no full-file loads for large NDJSON).
- Added unit tests for manifest byte stability and exporter integration.

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Met (required fields present; determinism proven by tests; CI required before closure).
- Determinism: JSON uses `.sortedKeys`; arrays are sorted by relative path; no timestamps included.
- Performance: Hashing/counting is streaming; scales better for large NDJSON files.
- Privacy: Manifest contains only run_id, relative paths, sizes, hashes, and counts (no PHI/PII).

Risks / edge cases
- If additional streams are added later, update the manifest file list + row_counts mapping and extend tests accordingly.
