# Review: Issue #25 — NDJSON schema_version + record_key

Reviewed with: `ollama/llama3.1:8b`

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/25

## Summary
- Added explicit `schema_version` (int) and `record_key` (string) fields to every NDJSON row.
- Validator now enforces these fields.
- Documentation updated to describe the new fields and their relationship to existing `event_key`.

## Risks / Gaps
- [severity: low] Downstream tools currently use `event_key`; keeping it avoids churn, but long-term we should migrate loaders to treat `record_key` as canonical (Issue #26).

## Determinism + privacy checks
- `record_key` is deterministic (sha256-based) and does not require PII.
- Outputs remain byte-stable across reruns (existing tests).

## CI / artifacts checklist
- Confirm CI green:
  - Linux tests job
  - macOS Xcode job with `ios-xcresult` artifact
- Post Actions run URL on Issue #25 and close the issue after verification.
