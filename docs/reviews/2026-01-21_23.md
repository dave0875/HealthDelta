# Review: Issue #23 — Plan refresh

Reviewed with: `ollama/llama3.1:8b`

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/23

## Summary
- Updated the share-safe living plan to reflect completion of Issues #17–#22 and to enumerate Issues #23–#32 in priority order.

## Risks / Gaps
- [severity: low] Plan entries can drift if issues are re-scoped; keep this document updated at each backlog boundary.
- [severity: low] Use consistent labels in `docs/plan.md` (e.g., “done” vs “completed”) to reduce ambiguity.

## Determinism + privacy checks
- Share-safe: contains only issue links and high-level intent; no PII, secrets, or absolute local paths.

## CI / artifacts checklist
- Confirm CI green:
  - Linux tests job
  - macOS Xcode job with `ios-xcresult` artifact
- Post Actions run URL on Issue #23 and close the issue after verification.
