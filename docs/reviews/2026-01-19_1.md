# Review — 2026-01-19 — Issue #1

Model: `ollama/llama3.1:8b`

## Scope
Bootstrap the repo skeleton and operating rules (no product logic).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Root contains `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `TIME.csv`, and `.codex/`: met.
- `.codex/` contains `README.md`, `prompts/bootstrap.md`, and `.codex/sessions/2026-01-19/session_1.md`: met.
- `.github/` contains required issue template + PR template requiring issue reference: met.
- `.env` is ignored and no secrets are committed: met (via `.gitignore`; verify before each commit).
- `docs/` has baseline architecture and threat-model stubs: met.

## Process Compliance
- Issue-driven: Issue #1 exists and uses the mandatory story format.
- Codex audit: prompt + session logs created under `.codex/`.
- Time logging: `TIME.csv` row added for this session.

## Risks / Gaps
- Shell quoting hazard: backticks in `gh issue create` bodies must be single-quoted or passed via a file/heredoc to avoid command substitution.
- `.env` hygiene depends on ongoing discipline; keep `.env` ignored and never copy secrets into `.codex/` or docs.

## Recommendation
- Close Issue #1 after the skeleton is committed and pushed to `main`.
