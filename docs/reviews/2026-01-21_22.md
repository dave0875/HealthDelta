# Review: Issue #22 — Profile “Next Steps” recommendations

Reviewed with: `ollama/llama3.1:8b`

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/22

## Summary
- Added a `## Next Steps` section to `profile.md` that recommends deterministic, share-safe next commands based on detected export contents.
- Recommendations use placeholders and do not print any absolute paths.
- Tests assert the section exists and remains byte-stable across reruns.

## Risks / Gaps
- [severity: low] Recommendations may need updates as CLI flags evolve; tests will catch drift in key command strings.

## Determinism + privacy checks
- Output is deterministic (static strings + content-derived conditionals already in profile).
- Share-safe: no absolute paths; no names/DOB/identifiers; no payload fragments.

## CI / artifacts checklist
- Confirm CI green:
  - Linux tests job
  - macOS Xcode job with `ios-xcresult` artifact
- Post Actions run URL on Issue #22 and close the issue after verification.
