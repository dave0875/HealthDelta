# Review: Issue #16 — Living Plan/Backlog + Local Issue Artifacts

Reviewed with: `ollama/llama3.1:8b`

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/16

## Summary
- Adds share-safe, lightweight in-repo planning documentation:
  - `docs/plan.md` (living plan/backlog linking the next prioritized GitHub issues)
  - `docs/issues/README.md` (local issue artifact template)
  - `docs/issues/ISSUE-0016.md` (local artifact entry for Issue #16)
- Updates `AGENTS.md` to reference the living plan.

## Risks / Gaps
- [severity: low] Plan/backlog can become stale if not updated regularly.
  - Mitigation: keep it short and update it whenever priorities change or when new issues are created/closed.

## Governance / Privacy checks
- No secrets or tokens introduced.
- No PII/PHI introduced; documents are share-safe and reference only GitHub URLs and repo-relative paths.

## CI / artifacts checklist
- Confirm CI green for the Issue #16 commit:
  - Linux tests job
  - macOS Xcode job with `ios-xcresult` artifact
- Post Actions run URL on Issue #16 and close the issue only after verification.
