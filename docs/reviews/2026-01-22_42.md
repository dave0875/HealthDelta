# Review — Issue 42 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/42

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Added `docs/adr/ADR_4_ingestion_paths_convergence.md` documenting the Apple export pipeline vs iOS incremental export path and the shared invariants (determinism, share-safety, person-keying).
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reference the new ADR.

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Met (ADR added under `docs/adr/`; references both paths, shared invariants, and NDJSON alignment; `AGENTS.md` updated).
- Privacy/share-safety: ADR uses only schema-level vocabulary and avoids any PHI/PII examples.
- Future-proofing: ADR frames “alignment” as a contract (required core fields + explicit mapping) to reduce drift.

Risks / edge cases
- ADR may become stale as new streams/resources are added; keep the invariants section authoritative and update the “NDJSON alignment” section when new canonical streams are introduced.
