# Review — Issue 33 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/33

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Added immutable prompt `.codex/prompts/issue_33.md`.
- Added local issue artifact `docs/issues/ISSUE-0033.md`.
- Updated `docs/plan.md` to move Issues #23–#32 to Completed and list Issues #33–#42 with short, linked summaries.
- Added session log `.codex/sessions/2026-01-22/session_33.md` (CI link pending until GitHub Actions run completes).

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Satisfied for plan refresh + artifacts; CI evidence still needs to be filled in after the run completes.
- Determinism: Plan ordering is explicit and stable (issue-number ordering; no time-varying content).
- Privacy: Share-safe documentation only; no PII/PHI or absolute local paths introduced.

Risks / edge cases
- Ensure the session log and Issue #33 comment include the final CI run link and confirm `ios-xcresult` artifact presence before closing.
