# HealthDelta Issue #2 Final Verification Review
=============================================

## Acceptance Criteria Status
-----------------------------

| Acceptance Criterion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [AC1]: Non-iOS tests run successfully on Ubuntu host. | Pass (CI run: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160035185) |
| [AC2]: Xcode simulator tests run successfully on self-hosted macOS runner. | Pass (CI run: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160035185) |
| [AC3]: Device smoke workflow runs successfully on self-hosted macOS runner. | Pass (Device smoke run: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160108632) |

## CI Evidence Links
---------------------

* Non-iOS tests: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160035185
* Xcode simulator tests: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160035185 (same link as above)
* Device smoke workflow: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/actions/runs/21160108632

## Artifact Proof
-----------------

The following artifacts have been uploaded to GitHub:

* `ios-xcresult` bundle for Xcode simulator tests (CI run)
* `device-smoke-xcresult` bundle for device smoke workflow (Device smoke run)

## Runner Label Requirements
------------------------------

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `self-hosted` | The self-hosted macOS runner must have the label `self-hosted`. |
| `macOS` | The self-hosted macOS runner must have the label `macOS`. |
| `arm64` | The self-hosted macOS runner must have the label `arm64`. |
| `xcode` | The self-hosted macOS runner must have the label `xcode`. |

## Remaining Risks
-------------------

* The self-hosted macOS runner is still a relatively new setup, and there may be unforeseen issues that arise. Monitoring its operational reliability will continue to be important.
* As always, repository mutations (code, workflows, docs, commits, pushes) are executed ONLY on the Ubuntu host “GORF”, which may introduce additional complexity in case of issues.
