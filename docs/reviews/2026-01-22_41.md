# Review — Issue 41 (2026-01-22)

Issue: https://github.com/dave0875/HealthDelta/issues/41

Reviewer model
- `ollama/llama3.1:8b` (invoked locally on GORF)

Change summary
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to capture Linux `unittest` output to `artifacts/linux/unittest.log` and upload it as a `linux-unittest` artifact (even on failure), while still failing the job when tests fail.

Findings
- Acceptance criteria: Met (Linux unittest output is persisted as an artifact with deterministic naming; CI remains authoritative).
- Determinism: Artifact name and paths are stable; logs are captured consistently.
- Security/privacy: No secrets introduced; logs should remain synthetic-only per repo rules.
- JUnit on Linux: Not implemented because generating JUnit from `unittest` would require adding a new framework/dependency or extra tooling, which is explicitly out of scope for Issue #41.

Risks / edge cases
- If tests print fixture payloads, those strings would be included in artifacts; keep fixtures synthetic and avoid printing contents.
