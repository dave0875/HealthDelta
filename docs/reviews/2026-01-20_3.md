**HealthDelta Issue #3: Codex Governance Lock-in**
=====================================================

### Self Review
---------------

#### Prompt/Execution Discipline

* **Codification**: AGENTS.md correctly codifies prompt/execution discipline, providing a clear framework for working within the HealthDelta repository.
* **Unambiguity**: The documentation is unambiguous in its requirements, eliminating confusion and ensuring that all contributors follow the same guidelines.

### Scope

* **Issue Scoping**: AGENTS.md effectively maintains issue scoping by prohibiting changes to issue scope or acceptance criteria through follow-up prompts (beyond `issue_N_followup_9`).
* **Avoiding Scope Creep**: The documentation ensures that new issues are created when scope creep is unavoidable, preventing the blurring of issue boundaries.

### Governance

* **Codex Governance**: AGENTS.md establishes a comprehensive Codex governance framework, binding all future sessions and contributors to its principles.
* **Project Law**: The documentation enforces project law by clearly outlining rules and responsibilities for contributing to HealthDelta.

### Best Practices

* **TDD and CI**: The use of TDD (required for non-trivial logic) and the enforcement of observable, persisted artifacts from CI work contribute to robust testing and reliability.
* **Codex Audit Trail**: The mandatory recording of substantial prompts, sessions, decisions, and architectural decisions ensures a clear audit trail for future reference.

### Areas for Improvement

* **Runbook Documentation**: While Xcode + self-hosted runner operations are documented in `docs/runbook_xcode.md`, further clarification on how these runbooks relate to the Codex governance framework would enhance overall understanding.
* **Follow-up Prompt Mechanics**: The follow-up prompt mechanism could benefit from additional example usage or edge cases to ensure contributors fully grasp its implications.

### Conclusion
-----------------

AGENTS.md successfully codifies and enforces a comprehensive prompt/execution discipline, maintaining issue scoping and avoiding scope creep. The Codex governance framework is clear, well-defined, and binding for all future sessions. While areas for improvement exist, the documentation overall provides a solid foundation for contributing to HealthDelta.
